\section{Motivation}

Most of the points-to analyses depend only on the pointer assignments in
the source code. Other assignments for such analyses doesn't matter because
they do not affect pointers. For implementing these analyses, the
first step would be to extract these assignments from the IR which is quite a 
waste of time if someone has to write a number of such analysis. So instead of
wasting time on writing code for extracting these statements, this library 
provides an API for doing so easily. The implementer now only has to focus on 
implementing the analysis.

This library has been designed by keeping in mind the forward and backward
analysis and top-down and bottom-up analyses. So it generates constraint
without depending on the flow or context information.
