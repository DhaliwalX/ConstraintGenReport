\chapter{Introduction}

A number of points-to analysis have been developed. All these analysis have one 
thing in common that they depend upon some common properties of the pointers 
present in the source code of a program. These properties include information 
like the assignments to the pointers, type information, or level of indirection.
This information can represented in the form of set of constraints. These 
constraints correspond to the assignments in the source code. Only those 
assignments matter in which there is a write/read to pointer variable.

This library tries to extract this type of information in form of constraints 
from LLVM IR. It provides set of well defined APIs for generating constraints 
from LLVM IR.
